# ESLint is amazing.

## Getting Started
1. Copy code of the `eslintrc` into your own file at root of project.
2. `npm i --save-dev eslint eslint-plugin-react`
3. It helps if you wire eslint into webpack, though it can slow the build. Otherwise be sure to have an eslint package on your text editor to pick up on the rules in the `eslintrc` file.
